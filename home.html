                  The goal of this project was to practice A/B testing, and use statistical tests
                  to understand the results. Interfaces A and B were versions of a cacti shopping site,
                  where users can select cacti to purchase. I was able to collect data from users who were asked to
                  add $150 worth of cacti to their cart. I hypothesized about time to completion and return rate for both
                  interfaces, and used calculate t-score, chi-squared, and p-values to understand my data.

                      the <b>top left</b>. The images are smaller, so the user
                      can see more at once. The link to the checkout page
                      say <b>"checkout"</b> rather than "cart." <b>Site B</b> does not display
                      the cart total, the shopping cart is on the <b>top right, </b>
                      and the buttons are more prominent. The text is not centered,

                  I collected data from 28 users. The link given to the users opens as
                  interface A or B randomly. After users completed the task (add $150 worth of cacti to
                  cart and checkout), the following data was stored: type of page loaded (a, b, or c for checkout page),
                  time of page load and time of each button click. An example of this data is shown below.
                  After filtering the data, I was able to calculate the time to completion for each user, as well as record
                  whether a user returned to the cacti page. Examples of these calculations are also shown below.

                  that the differences seen between interface A and B are significant; this was not the case, so the
                  following findings are not significant, and my null hypotheses were not rejected.

                <p class="small-font">
                  Though the differences seen between interfaces A and B were not significant (p-values above 0.05),
                  I have concluded the following:
                 </p>
                <ul class="small-font" style="list-style: circle">
                  <li class="mt-2"> A key flaw in this experiment was the limited number of users (28). With this few users,
                  having a low p-value for either of my metrics is difficult. Having more users would allow real trends
                  to show in a statistically significant way. </li>
                  <li class="mt-2"> The data showed that site B performed better than site A in terms of the time to completion metric. This may have been due to the fact
                  that site B had less users, or chance. As this data the finding was not significant, I cannot make a
                  real conclusion about which interface is better</li>
                  <li class="mt-2"> I speculate that a lower return rate is superior to a higher one: a shopping site should be intuitive and easy to navigate
                    enough such that when a user decides to checkout, they are not met with any surprises and thus have no reason to return
                    back to the shopping page. The data showed that the return rate for interface A was lower than for interface B. As stated
                  in the hypotheses section, I believe that this is due to the fact that site A displayed the cart total ($) whereas site B did not.
                  In theory, this would give users less reason to return to the shopping page after navigation to checkout.</li>
                  <li class="mt-2"> As the users of my site were UIUX students doing the same experiment, I feel as though results are biased, and would
                  be meaningless even if the p-values were below 0.05. The users knew the purpose of the experiment, and were most probably
                  trying to get it done quickly (rather than naturally). </li>
